# GitHub Assignment

This project helped me to learn UNIX basics and about Github-- both how to use it and what it is. 

I accomplished this by using UNIX basics to create a directory called "Food" that had two subdirectories named "Fruit" and "Vegetable". I then created 3 text files in each of these subdirectories, with a sentence of information inside each text file. The sentences were just definitons of each fruit or vegetable.

The text files for the fruit subdirectory were:
* Apple.txt
* Peach.txt
* Orange.txt

The text files for the vegetable subdirectory were:
* Broccoli.txt
* Lettuce.txt
* Carrot.txt

Lastly, I created a GitHub account and a repository. I then uploaded these files to the repository.
